#### Intro to Data Wrangling  - Dplyr functions {.tabset}

<details open><summary class='drop'> Data Wrangling</summary>

This section will go over the use of dplyr functions to get your data.frame how you want.

We will do:

1) The pipe operator '%>%' or '|>' (shortcuts) if that did not come in mod 2
2) Dplyr commands: 
  a) filter (w/ boolean operators), mutate, 
  b) select and rename
  c) arrange
  d) pull + table
  e) group_by + mutate
  f) group_by + summarize
3) Think of commands as verbs that do a thing, with pipes that string them together
4) If this is not too long bring up lag, lead, etc in group_by mutates
