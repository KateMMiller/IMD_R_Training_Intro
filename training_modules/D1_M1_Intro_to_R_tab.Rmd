#### Intro to R & RStudio{.tabset}

<details open><summary class='drop'>Introduction to R and RStudio</summary>
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is a shell around the R program. Programming in the R language is made way easier by the advent of RStudio. When you open RStudio, you typically see 4 panes:

<img src="./images/RStudio.jpg" alt="RStudio" width="800">

<ul class="disc">
  <li><b>Source:</b> the pane is the top left, and is where you can load and write scripts. When you're ready to run the scripts you can  
  either highlight a line or lines and click "Run" or hit Ctrl+Enter. That essentially sends the code to R (which is living in the 
  console), and you'll typically see some form of output in the console.</li>
    <ul class="square">
    <li>RStudio color codes functions, datasets, quoted strings, numbers, comments, etc. differently, so it's easier to read 
    code. You can customize the layout and appearance of your code by clicking on <b>Tools > Global Options</b>. For example, I prefer a dark 
    background, and use the Cobalt Editor Theme (under Appearance). Using that theme, comments are blue, numbers are magenta, quoted
    strings are green, etc.</li>
    <li>RStudio checks your code and updates the colors as you go. If, for example, you have an unclosed parentheses pair in your code, 
    you will see Xs to the left of the line number and sometimes a little squiggle under a word. If you missed a closing quote, it will 
    turn all of your following code the color of text (green in my case) until you close the quote. This makes it easier to spot where you
    missed the closing quote.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Console:</b> the pane in the bottom left is essentially where R lives. When you first open RStudio, the console will tell you the
  version of R that you're running under the hood. You can type code directly in the console, or you can write scripts and send the code to
  the console.</li>
  <li><b>Environment Window:</b> this pane in the top right shows you the objects loaded in your environment that are accessible to you.  
  You can also click on objects and view them.</li>  
    <ul class="square">
    <li>The history tab in this pane shows the code you've run in the current session, and can be a way to recover lines you ran 
    but maybe overwrote/saved in your script (In other words, I rarely go here, but it's saved me in a big way in the past!)</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Workspace:</b> the pane in the bottom right shows the files within your working directory.</li>
    <ul class="square">
    <li>The Plots tab will show plots that you create.</li>
    <li>The Packages tab allows you to turn on/off packages, and also view the help files within each package.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<details open><summary class='drop'>Useful keystrokes</summary>
Once you get in the swing of coding, you'll find that minimizing the number of times you have to use your mouse will speed up your coding. RStudio has done a really good job of creating a ton of keyboard shortcuts to keep your hands on the keyboard instead of having to click through menus. One way to see all of the shortcuts RStudio has built in is to press <b>Alt+Shift+K</b>, and a window should appear with a bunch of shortcuts listed. These are also listed on <a href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf">RStudio's IDE Cheat Sheet</a>. The shortcuts I use the most often are listed below:
<ul><li>UNDO: Ctrl+Z</li>
<li>REDO: Ctrl+Y</li>
<li>Run highlighted code: Ctrl Enter</li>
<li>Restart R Session: Ctrl Shift F10</li>
<li>Move mouse to Source pane: Ctrl 1</li>
<li>Move mouse to Console pane: Ctrl 2</li>
<li>Insert pipe (%>%): Ctrl Shift M</li>
<li>Insert "<-" : Alt - </li> 
<li>Zoom in to make text bigger: Ctrl Shift + </li>
<li>Zoom out: Ctrl - </li>
<li>Clear console: Ctrl L </li>
<li>Duplicate line of code: Ctrl Shift D</li>
<li>Move line of code up or down: Alt arrow up or down</li>
</ul>

<details open><summary class='drop'>Global Options</summary>
There are several settings in the Global Options that we'll want to all have consistent. To make sure you have the correct settings, go to:

<h3>Tools > Global Options</h3> 

Under the General tab, you should see that your R Version is [64-bit] and the version is R-4.0.0. If it's not, you need to change it to that. Most settings can be whatever you prefer, including everything in the Appearance. The most important setting is to make sure you are not saving your history. When R saves your history, you start with the same workspace (including data loaded in the global environment), which seems like a good thing. However, the whole point of using R is that your code should return the same results every time you run it. Clearing your history every time you close RStudio forces you to test that your code is still returning the same results. If you happen to be working with huge datasets that take awhile to load and process, saving your history and RData are useful. Otherwise, clear your history by default by making sure <i>Always save history (even when not saving .RData)</i> is not checked. Also make sure the <i>Restore .RData into your workspace at startup</i> is unchecked. If you need to do that, you can run 1 line of code instead (load.Rdata("filename.Rdata")).

<details open><summary class='drop'>Loading dependencies</summary>
While base R (everything that comes with the installation from CRAN) comes with a lot of useful functions, there are also a lot of great packages (aka libraries) out there that make data wrangling, analysis and plotting easier and more efficient. The packages we will rely on the most this season are: 
<ul>
  <li><i>dplyr:</i> data wrangling functions including filtering (subsetting), arranging, and summarizing</li>
  <li><i>tidyr:</i> reshaping data from long to wide and vice versa</li>
  <li><i>rgdal:</i> to set coordinate systems and create shapefiles </li>
  <li><i>forestMIDN:</i> for importing, joining, and summarizing data specific to MIDN</li>
  <li><i>devtools:</i> required to install packages from github</li>
</ul>
Note that <i>dplyr</i> and <i>tidyr</i> are part of the <i>tidyverse</i>, which is a collection of a lot of really useful packages. Instead of only installing <i>dplyr</i> and <i>tidyr</i> individually, I recommend installing and loading the <i>tidyverse</i>, which will load those packages, along with several other useful packages.

<p class='code'>To install packages, run the code chunk below:</p>

</ul>
```{r, c1, echo=T, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rgdal", "devtools"))
devtools::install_github("katemmiller/forestMIDN")

```
You only need to run the previous code chunk once. After these packages are installed, you can just load the libraries. A couple of notes about packages.
<ul>
  <li> Best practices for writing code are to load all of the packages you will use at the top of the script, so that it's obvious early to another user if they need to install a package.</li> 
  <li>You only need devtools to install the forestMIDN package on github. Once forestMIDN is installed, you don't need to load devtools again.</li>
  <li> The tidyverse and rgdal can take awhile to install, but once they're installed they are quick to load.</li>
  <li> Note the use of :: in the code chunk above. That's another way to use functions in a package without loading the package. I only use this for packages like devtools, which I only use once in a script and I use it early. The :: symbol also comes in handy if you're loading packages that have the same function name. </li>
  <li> To install a package, the name needs to be in quotes. To load the package via library(), you don't quote the package name. Don't ask me why...</li>
</ul>

<p class='code'>To load the packages, run the code chunk below:</p>
```{r, c2, echo=T, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rgdal)
library(forestMIDN)

```

If you get an error that says there is no package called "x", it means that package didn't install properly, and you should try installing the package again. 

A couple of tips for troubleshooting the forestMIDN package install. 
<ol>
<li>Install Rtools for Windows 64-bit. The download page is <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">here.</a></li> 
<li>If the error you're getting is mentioning the package backports, try doing the following:</li> 
  <ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
  <li>Download the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/4.0/backports_1.1.7.zip">Windows Binaries</a> for backports.</li>
  <li>Install backports from file in RStudio by going to <i>Tools> Install Packages> Install From:</i> Change the Install From option to "Package Archive File" and select backports_1.1.17.zip.</li></ol>
  <li>Now try installing devtools and forestMIDN (install.packages("devtools"); devtools::install_github('katemmiller/forestMIDN'))</li>
</li>
</ol>
