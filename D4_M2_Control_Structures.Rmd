Thomas - put together a small sample dataset of CSV hobo files for reading in and manipulating using iteration.

control structures
-if/else
  
-iteration 
    -for loop - cover for loops in depth
    -apply family - covered more in depth on day 6
      -apply
      -lapply
    -purrr - covered more in depth on day 6

-vectorization - examples of vectorized functions
    -gsub, grep family (avoid regex)
    -basic vector math
      -rowsums vs colsums
    -inequalities  ==, <, >, %in%
    -& , |, (maybe get into &&, || )

-other control structures to be aware of.

NOT FOR TAB: Break to discuss other hard questions from previous days - especially how you integrate it into iteration.
