#### Saving tabular data to file 

The last thing today is how to write the data you're working on to a file in your computer.
<p class='code'>The following code saves the wetland data using a different file name:</p>

```{r orgD2M5, echo=F, eval=F, include=F}
#--------------------
#    Day 2 Mod 5
#--------------------
```

```{r,c30, echo=T, results='hide'}
write.csv(wetdat, "./data/ACAD_wetland_data2.csv")
```
You should now see a new file in your data folder. 

We're not actually going to use that file for anything, so you can delete it now (either manually, or running the following code.)
```{r, c31, echo=T, results='hide'}
file.remove("./data/ACAD_wetland_data2.csv")
```
